      <description>Introduction This post will introduce the steps needed in order to setup a Windows endpoint to forward logs to Logstash. The following diagram shows a layout of how all the components will interact with each other.
On the Endpoint we have logs that we want to ship to Elasticsearch, these logs include various system logs generated by Windows and Sysmon logs. The Sysmon logs are generated by another program installed on the system which will monitor events related to processes being created and registry values being changed.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post will aim to give an overview of TLS and public key infrastructure (PKI). This first part of this post will give a theoretical overview of how it works. The second part of the post will demonstrate how to setup a CA with OpenSSL and create certificates for web servers and code singing purposes. Furthermore, the code signing certificate will be used to sign a binary on a Windows machine.</description>
